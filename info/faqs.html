                                        The PF HOA was incorporated in 1996 by the developer of Prairie Fields subdivision.  From 1996 to 
                                        2008, the developer performed and paid for all services of the HOA.  Starting in 2009, the 
                                        developer transitioned the association to a resident run, resident funded HOA, and in the fall of 
                                        2009 the residents of Prairie Fields elected a Board of Directors (BOD).

                                        Covenants are legal documents that lay out the guidelines for the planned community. The Covenants are recorded in the county records 
                                        in the county where the property is located and are legally binding. This means 
                                        that when you purchase a lot or a home in Prairie Fields you automatically become a member of the HOA.  The Covenants, which were 
                                        established by the builder, are the rules of the Prairie Fields neighborhood. They govern what you can, cannot, or must do with 
                                        respect to your home.

                                        Because each phase of the subdivision has different covenants, the Board of Directors has a committee 
                                        evaluating consolidating the different covenants into one set which would apply to all homes in PF. The 
                                        consolidated covenants would have to be approved by 75% of the residents of each phase of PF, which won’t

                                        The Prairie Fields HOA does not regulate any of these items. The US Supreme Court has ruled that homeowners 
                                        associations cannot restrict reasonably sized antenna or satallites. However, the Village of Savoy does 
                                        have restrictions on both Solar Panels and Windmills.  Windmills generally must be positioned so that they 
                                        do not fall onto a neighbor’s property. The Village of Savoy also has restrictions about height of windmills.

                                        Most Homeowners Associations of newer neighborhoods in the Champaign-Urbana area charge $100.00

                                        money, but it is what the Board of Directors determined was necessary to cover current expenses

                                        the neighborhood that we maintain- a total of more than 12 acres of grass, trees, berms, ditches, 
                                        and two detention basins.  The budget also includes liability insurance, printing, copying, 
                                        postage, power bills for the subdivision sign, etc.  Just under half of the budget is set aside 
                                        for capital improvements, which include the costs of repairing HOA owned storm drain tiles and
